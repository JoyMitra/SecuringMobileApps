										###A study of security rules in Android : A Technical report###


# Abstract #

Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems today. A large number of apps in a plethora of domains are being developed for it everyday. A number of these apps deal with sensitive information which if compromised can have dire consequences for the user. Therefore, developers have an added responsibility to develop apps that are secure. In this paper we study a bunch of security rules and find out how they can be enforced without hampering the current approach that developers follow to build apps on Android.
